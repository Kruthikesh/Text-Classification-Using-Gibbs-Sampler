# Text-Classification-Using-Gibbs-Sampler
Course project for 'Simulation of Stochastic and Random Process'

## Classifies text samples as spam or ham, treating some portion of the labelled samples as data. Acheives higher accuracy with data and eventually saturates once the balance condition of the Markov Chain is reached. Developed and coded from [research paper](https://github.com/Kruthikesh/Text-Classification-Using-Gibbs-Sampler/files/15346709/text_clas.pdf) and improvised the code by vectorising some loops due to which the execution time decreased by 7 times.
